             AI Preferences for Real-Time Protocol Bindings
         draft-altanai-aipref-realtime-protocol-bindings-latest

Abstract

   This document defines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) preference
   expressions are bound to signaling and media protocols used for real-
   time, session-based communications such as the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) and associated Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   offers.  It specifies a reusable binding model, concrete SIP header
   field conventions, and SDP attributes that allow endpoints,
   intermediary services, and AI assistants to advertise, negotiate, and
   enforce requirements about AI-driven processing of session metadata,
   media control events, and telemetry.  The goal is to align real-time
   protocol behavior with the AI Preferences (AIPREF) vocabulary without
   disrupting existing call control semantics.

1.  Introduction

   Real-time communications (RTC) deployments are increasingly assisted
   by AI-driven components that evaluate signaling metadata, media
   control messages, and quality of experience (QoE) measurements.
   Examples include AI-based call routing, automated troubleshooting,
   adaptive encoding, or compliance monitoring.  When these components
   operate on user or service provider data, the AI Preferences (AIPREF)
   working group requires that stakeholders can express and enforce
   preferences that describe what AI systems may inspect, retain, or
   export.

   Existing AIPREF documents define preference vocabularies and
   repository behavior, but do not specify how those preferences are
   conveyed through session control protocols.  This document fills that
   gap for SIP-based systems and applies the same pattern to other RTC
   bindings that reuse SIP constructs (including SIP events, PUBLISH,
   and WebRTC gateways).  The binding guidance is protocol-agnostic
   where possible so that additional RTC protocols (such as XMPP Jingle
   or proprietary session controllers) can follow the same pattern.

1.1.  Goals

   The binding framework MUST:

   1.  Preserve backwards compatibility with SIP user agents, gateways,
       and middleboxes that are unaware of AI preference signaling.

   2.  Permit endpoints and administrative domains to advertise locally
       enforced AI policies and to consume peer policies before AI
       processing begins.

   3.  Support mid-dialog updates so that AI processing can adapt when
       session context changes (e.g., escalation from audio to video,
       invoking transcription services, or triggering automated
       remediation workflows).

   4.  Allow binding of AI preferences to both signaling-layer artifacts
       (message bodies, header fields, event packages) and media-layer
       descriptions (SDP attributes, record routes, and telemetry
       streams).

1.2.  Scope

   This document describes:

   *  A binding model that maps AIPREF vocabulary elements to SIP dialog
      state and SDP descriptions.

   *  A compact token and URI-based encoding carried in SIP header
      fields and bodies.

   *  Procedures for preference discovery, negotiation, and error
      handling across dialogs, subscriptions, and conferencing
      primitives.

   *  Operational recommendations for intermediaries, policy servers,
      and AI enforcement points.

   This document does not standardize AI algorithms, privacy-preserving
   enforcement techniques, or the semantics of individual AIPREF
   vocabularies beyond referencing existing definitions in other working
   group documents such as [I-D.aipref-network-privacy-control].

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology defined in RFC3261, RFC3264, and the AIPREF framework
   documents applies.  This document additionally uses the following
   conventions:

   *  *AI Preference Token (APT)*: A compact, possibly signed
      representation of one or more AIPREF statements, retrievable via
      URI or carried inline.

   *  *Preference Attacher*: The SIP entity that injects an APT into
      signaling or SDP (e.g., originating user agent, outbound proxy, or
      application server).

   *  *Preference Enforcement Point (PEP)*: A network element or AI
      component that validates and enforces APT requirements prior to
      processing protected data.

   *  *Real-Time Preference Channel*: Any mechanism that conveys updated
      APTs after a dialog is established (e.g., re-INVITE, UPDATE, INFO,
      SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY pair).

3.  Binding Requirements

   The following requirements guide bindings for SIP and related RTC
   protocols:

   *  *Visibility*: APTs SHOULD be visible to the entities that are
      expected to enforce them, including downstream AI assistants.
      When hop-by-hop protection (e.g., TLS) is applied, intermediaries
      outside the trust domain MUST NOT rely on APTs they cannot
      validate.

   *  *Integrity*: APTs SHOULD be signed or integrity-protected when
      transported across untrusted proxies to prevent unauthorized
      downgrades.

   *  *Idempotency*: Repeated delivery of identical APTs MUST NOT cause
      state divergence.  Implementations MAY treat the most recent valid
      APT as authoritative.

   *  *Granularity*: Bindings MUST allow preferences scoped to dialogs,
      media sections, or individual features (e.g., telemetry streams,
      AI feature lists).  APTs therefore include target metadata
      identifying the scope (dialog-id, media mid, or subscription
      identifier).

   *  *Fallback*: Endpoints that cannot satisfy received preferences
      MUST reject or redirect the request using standard SIP procedures
      (e.g., 488 Not Acceptable Here) and SHOULD include diagnostic
      information.

4.  Binding Model

   The model in Figure 1 illustrates how preferences flow through RTC
   signaling.

   ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ │ Preference │ APT
   │ SIP Binding │ APT │ Enforcement │ │ Originator ├─────▶│ Transport
   ├─────▶│ Point / AI │ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
   └──────────────┘ ▲ │ │ │ Publish / Fetch │ Dialog signaling │ Media /
   Data └──────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘

   1.  An originator (user agent, operator policy engine, or regulator)
       issues an APT identifier or token.

   2.  The preference attacher embeds the token using one or more
       bindings defined in this document.

   3.  Enforcement points inside AI workloads retrieve, validate, and
       apply the referenced constraints before consuming protected data.

   Bindings MUST reference the same canonical APT identifier when
   expressing preferences across signaling and media layers to avoid
   ambiguity.

5.  SIP Signaling Binding

5.1.  AI-Pref Header Field

   This document defines the AI-Pref SIP header field.  Each instance
   conveys metadata that allows receivers to retrieve or validate an
   APT.

   AI-Pref = "AI-Pref" HCOLON pref-value *(COMMA pref-value) pref-value
   = pref-id *(SEMI pref-param) pref-id = token / quoted-string ;
   identifier or opaque token pref-param = ("scope" EQUAL token) /
   ("type" EQUAL token) / ("version" EQUAL 1*DIGIT) / ("integrity" EQUAL
   token) / ("uri" EQUAL LAQUOT absoluteURI RAQUOT)

5.1.1.  Usage Rules

   1.  *Initial INVITE*: The originating user agent server (UAC) SHOULD
       include an AI-Pref header referencing all preferences that govern
       AI handling of dialog metadata or media diagnostics.  The header
       MAY appear multiple times when different scopes are advertised
       (e.g., scope=dialog, scope=media).

   2.  *Provisional Responses*: Proxies and user agent servers (UAS) MAY
       add AI-Pref headers to responses in order to enumerate additional
       policies that downstream AI components MUST accept before the
       session is confirmed.

   3.  *ACK and PRACK*: These messages MUST echo the latest accepted AI-
       Pref identifiers when the UAS requires confirmation.  Absence of
       AI-Pref in ACK implies acceptance of the most recent set.

   4.  *Mid-Dialog Updates*: Re-INVITE and UPDATE requests MUST include
       AI-Pref whenever the preference scope of any media stream is
       modified.  This allows AI systems that adapt encoders, perform
       transcription, or modify layouts to obey updated constraints.

   5.  *SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY*: Event packages (e.g., dialog package, KPML,
       presence) MAY carry AI-Pref headers so that AI assistants
       consuming event payloads adhere to the advertised constraints.

5.1.2.  Compact Tokens and URIs

   pref-id values can represent:

   *  Inline tokens that encode the full preference statement (e.g.,
      CBOR Web Token referencing vocabulary keys).

   *  Handles that require dereferencing via HTTPS using the uri
      parameter.

   *  Versioned identifiers that map to entries in a policy repository.

   Receivers MUST treat unknown parameters according to RFC3261 rules
   (ignore them) and MUST NOT assume that the absence of AI-Pref implies
   permission to process data without AI constraints.

5.1.3.  Error Handling

   *  If a UAS cannot comply with mandatory preferences, it SHOULD reply
      with 488 Not Acceptable Here and include a Warning header value of
      399 aipref "Preference unsupported".

   *  When integrity verification fails, the recipient SHOULD respond
      with 403 Forbidden and MAY include diagnostic details in a Reason
      header referencing AI-Integrity-Failure.

   *  Gateways that strip AI-Pref MUST insert a History-Info entry
      explaining the removal so downstream entities understand why
      enforcement data is missing.

5.2.  SIP Body Considerations

   When APTs are too large for header fields, this document RECOMMENDS
   embedding them inside a multipart body part with media type
   application/aipref+json or application/aipref+cbor and referencing
   that part via Content-ID.  This allows richer metadata (e.g., signed
   manifests) without overloading SIP header processing.

6.  SDP and Media Binding

6.1.  a=aipref Attribute

   An SDP media description MAY include one or more a=aipref attributes,
   each binding a specific media stream to an APT identifier.

   a=aipref:<scope> <identifier> [<parameter>=<value> ...]

   Valid scopes include session, group, and mid.  Parameters align with
   the AI Pref vocabulary, for example:

   *  features=media-metrics,rtcp-xr

   *  retention=24h

   *  export=aggregated-only

   Endpoints MUST ensure that SDP attributes remain consistent with SIP-
   level AI-Pref headers.  If SDP renegotiation removes an attribute,
   the corresponding AI processing MUST stop or transition to the
   remaining allowed scope.

6.2.  RTP Control and Telemetry

   RTP control protocols such as RTCP, RTCP XR, and RTP/RTCP extensions
   for feedback may carry AI-relevant telemetry.  Implementations SHOULD
   map telemetry streams to the same APT identifiers declared in SDP by
   including the identifier in RTCP SDES items or header extensions
   defined for this purpose.  When that is not feasible, implementations
   MAY rely on the dialog-level AI-Pref scope while documenting the
   implicit association.

7.  Preference Discovery and Synchronization

7.1.  Retrieval via HTTPS

   Preferences referenced via uri MUST be retrievable over HTTPS with
   mutual authentication when sensitive.  Servers SHOULD support
   conditional requests and caching so intermediaries can reuse
   validated APTs across multiple dialogs.

7.2.  Repository Interaction

   Policy repositories MAY expose a REST interface where clients submit
   dialog metadata (Call-ID, From-tag, To-tag) and receive the
   authoritative list of applicable APT identifiers.  This pattern is
   especially useful for large conferencing services where centralized
   policy engines coordinate AI workloads.

7.3.  Conflict Resolution

   When multiple APTs apply to the same resource, the following
   precedence rules apply unless a policy repository states otherwise:

   1.  User-specific preferences override domain defaults.

   2.  Domain-level regulatory requirements override individual
       relaxations.

   3.  The most restrictive constraint wins when two preferences
       conflict on the same vocabulary key.

   Endpoints MAY advertise their conflict-resolution policy through the
   policy parameter inside AI-Pref headers (e.g., policy=strictest-
   wins).

8.  Operational Considerations

   *  *Logging*: Preference attachers SHOULD log emitted APT identifiers
      alongside Call-ID values to support audits and incident response.

   *  *Testing*: Interoperability testing MUST verify that dialogs
      proceed when AI-Pref is absent, ensuring that legacy devices
      remain compatible.

   *  *Scaling*: Implementations SHOULD compress header fields using SIP
      over HTTP/3 (RFC9397) or similar transports when large preference
      sets are common.

   *  *Federation*: Peering domains MAY translate local preference
      identifiers into a shared namespace.  Translation MUST NOT weaken
      constraints without explicit consent from the originator.

9.  Security Considerations

   Preferences often contain sensitive information about user intent,
   regulatory exposure, or organizational policy.  Therefore:

   *  Transport security such as TLS (for SIP over TLS, WebSocket, or
      HTTP/3) MUST be used whenever an AI-Pref header or body carries
      tokens that could be replayed or tampered with.

   *  APT signatures SHOULD be validated before AI systems act on the
      encapsulated instructions.  Validation includes issuer
      authentication, expiration checks, and revocation status.

   *  Implementations MUST guard against downgrade attacks where a
      malicious intermediary strips AI-Pref headers.  Techniques include
      SIPS-only routing, end-to-end integrity with S/MIME, or redundant
      signaling through policy repositories.

   *  Preference tokens SHOULD minimize personally identifiable
      information.  Instead of embedding explicit user identifiers, use
      pseudonymous handles that map to access-controlled directories.

   *  Systems MUST treat AI enforcement failures as security incidents
      when they result in unauthorized data processing.  Telemetry
      SHOULD be rate-limited to avoid revealing preference patterns to
      attackers probing the signaling fabric.

9.1.  Privacy and End-User Impact Considerations

   Real-time and session-oriented communication protocols (e.g., SIP,
   SDP, WebRTC, RTP/RTCP, QUIC-RTC) directly mediate human-to-human
   interaction.  Introducing AI-usage preference signaling into these
   protocols therefore has immediate consequences for end users,
   including creators, participants, accessibility users, researchers,
   and the general public.  This section outlines considerations
   necessary to ensure that AIPREF signaling in real-time environments
   does not unintentionally restrict legitimate uses, undermine user
   autonomy, or create new privacy risks.

9.1.1.  Impact on User Autonomy and Consent

   AI-usage preferences expressed at the signaling or media layer may be
   interpreted as binding restrictions by downstream systems.
   Implementations MUST ensure that:

   *  Preferences are treated as expressions of intent, not as
      access-control mechanisms.

   *  End users retain the ability to override platform-imposed defaults
      when they are the originators of the content.

   *  Intermediaries (e.g., conferencing platforms, SIP proxies, TURN
      servers, media mixers) do not silently substitute or modify
      user-provided preferences.

   Because real-time sessions often involve multiple participants,
   systems SHOULD provide clear and accessible mechanisms for users to
   understand what AI-related preferences are being signaled on their
   behalf.

9.1.2.  Avoiding Over-Restriction of Beneficial Uses

   Real-time communication is frequently used for accessibility
   (captioning, translation), education, archiving, and research.
   Overly broad or ambiguous preference categories—particularly those
   related to “AI Input” or “AI Training”—may unintentionally block
   beneficial, lawful, or expected uses.

   Implementations SHOULD:

   *  Distinguish between AI-assisted user features (e.g., live
      transcription) and model-building uses (e.g., training).

   *  Avoid treating a single preference (e.g., ai-input=n) as a blanket
      prohibition on all automated processing.

   *  Provide clear documentation on how preferences interact with
      accessibility features.

   Preference categories defined in AIPREF vocabulary drafts (e.g.,
   search, ai-input, ai-train) SHOULD be interpreted narrowly and
   consistently.

9.1.3.  Transparency to Participants

   Real-time sessions may involve dynamic negotiation (e.g., via SDP
   offer/answer).  When AI-usage preferences are conveyed:

   *  Endpoints SHOULD surface these preferences to human participants
      in a clear and non-technical manner.

   *  Systems SHOULD indicate when preferences differ between
      participants or when intermediaries have applied additional
      constraints.

   *  If preferences affect session features (e.g., disabling
      transcription), participants SHOULD be notified.

   Lack of transparency may create a chilling effect, where users avoid
   lawful or beneficial uses due to uncertainty.

9.1.4.  Intermediary Handling and Privacy Leakage

   Signaling AI-usage preferences at the session layer may inadvertently
   reveal information about user intent, content sensitivity, or
   organizational policy.  For example, a preference of ai-train=n may
   imply that the content is proprietary or confidential.

   To mitigate this:

   *  Intermediaries MUST NOT add, remove, or alter AI-usage preferences
      unless explicitly authorized by the originating endpoint.

   *  Preferences SHOULD be encrypted or integrity-protected when
      carried in protocols that support such mechanisms (e.g.,
      DTLS-SRTP, QUIC).

   *  Implementations SHOULD avoid exposing preferences in logs,
      analytics, or telemetry unless necessary and with appropriate
      safeguards.

9.1.5.  Compatibility with Archiving and Research

   Real-time communication is often recorded for compliance, education,
   or archival purposes.  AI-usage preferences SHOULD NOT be interpreted
   as prohibiting:

   *  lawful archiving,

   *  time-shifted review,

   *  accessibility processing, or

   *  research uses permitted by local law.

   Where preferences do apply to stored recordings, systems SHOULD
   preserve the preferences alongside the stored media, consistent with
   the behavior defined in draft-ietf-aipref-attach for HTTP
   representations.

9.1.6.  Avoiding Platform-Level Overreach

   Large communication platforms may be tempted to apply AI-usage
   preferences globally on behalf of users.  This can undermine user
   autonomy and distort the intent of AIPREF.

   Platforms SHOULD:

   *  Allow per-participant and per-stream preferences.

   *  Avoid applying organization-wide defaults without clear user
      visibility.

   *  Provide APIs for endpoints to express their own preferences
      without mediation.

9.1.7.  Interoperability and Open Ecosystem Considerations

   Real-time protocols are used across diverse environments, including
   open-source clients, small organizations, and global platforms.  To
   avoid fragmentation:

   *  Preferences SHOULD be optional and non-blocking.

   *  Absence of a preference MUST NOT be interpreted as consent.

   *  Implementations SHOULD follow the vocabulary and semantics defined
      in AIPREF drafts to ensure consistent interpretation across
      ecosystems.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to perform the following actions.

10.1.  SIP Header Field Registration

   Register the AI-Pref header field in the "Header Fields" sub-registry
   under "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters" with the
   following values:

   *  Header Name: AI-Pref

   *  Compact Form: none

   *  Reference: This document

10.2.  SDP Attribute Registration

   Register the aipref attribute in the "att-field (media level only)"
   registry defined by RFC4566 with the following values:

   *  Attribute name: aipref

   *  Type of attribute: media / session

   *  Subject to charset: no

   *  Purpose: Associates SDP media sections with AI preference tokens

   *  Reference: This document
